## pandas :panda_face:

This week, we are sticking to Python. Specifically, our focus will be on an add-on for Python called pandas. This might get confusing, so here's a link to a cheatsheet to refer back to whenever you're confused. Trust me, it'll be useful.

- [Pandas Cheat Sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)



## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. In JupyterLab, open a Launcher and select `Terminal`
2. Type in `cd CMPINF0010`

    - Or, **if you named your class folder something different**, replace `CMPINF0010` with whatever you named your folder
5. Now, copy and paste this command into the terminal
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/week-9.git
    ```
    - If you can't seem to paste anything, try using Ctrl+Shift+V (or Command+Shift+V)
6. You should see a new folder named `week-9` inside your class folder

### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to your computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:

## Note From Last Week:

Some of the problems from last week's assignment were decidedly difficult (though not NP-complete) and so in lab this week, we will review some of the harder questions and their solutions.
