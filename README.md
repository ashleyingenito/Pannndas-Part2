## Office hours

If you have questions about this week's lab, reading, or lecture, ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems. That being said, only email YOUR TA. Office hours will be held in the same place as usual. If none of these times work for you, please don't hesitate to reach out via email to set up another time.


## pandas :panda_face:

This week, we are sticking to Python. Specifically, our focus will be on an add-on for Python called pandas. This might get confusing, so here's a link to a cheatsheet to refer back to whenever you're confused. Trust me, it'll be useful.

- [Pandas Cheat Sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)


## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. Open Jupyter Lab and start a terminal
2. Navigate to the folder you wish to download this lab to
3. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/lab-8.git` and hit the enter key
4. This should download a folder to your local machine with the lab (it should be called lab-8)
5. Launch the desired notebook

## If Pulse Secure doesn't work for you

Use Pitt IT's [Virtual Lab](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/services/virtual-lab). I recommend using the Web Client as listed on that website. You can download and submit files to Canvas directly from the virtual lab instance. However, if you need to get files to your local machine, you should use **OneDrive**, since it it already set up on the machine. You can then download your files to your local machine from [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/).


## If JupyterLab doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to your computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.
